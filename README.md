## Installation

  1. Download or clone the repository
  ```
    - git clone git@github.com:ShaggyT/restaurant-reviews-app.git
    - cd restaurant-reviews-app
  ```
  2. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: ```python -V```. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 ```(or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use ```python3 -m http.server 8000```. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.

      * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.


  3. View the app in your browser at ``` http://localhost:8000 ```
